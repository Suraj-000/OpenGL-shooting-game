# OpenGL-3D-shooting-game

This is a 3D shooting game using OpenGL and GLFW.

Press SPACE to shoot.

Press B to accept the 3D world position of the centre of the target ball using console input space separated X, Y, and Z coordinates followed by a return. The target ball will to the (most recently) specified location.

Horizontal mouse motion on the game window (with the left key pressed) should rotate the entire gun about its vertical leg, and a vertical mouse drag should rotate the barrel vertically (as if on a hinge joint).

If ball hits the target you will get the output on console.
